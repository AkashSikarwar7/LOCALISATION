# LOCALISATION
    Localisation of Sensers by using some fixed number of HEAD-SENSER which have a fixed range of sensing.

# Localization Overview
    Localization is estimated through communication between localized node and unlocalized node for determining their geometrical             placement or position. Location is determined by means of distance and angle between nodes. There are many concepts used in               localization such as the following.

    (i)	
    Lateration occurs when distance between nodes is measured to estimate location.

    (ii)	
    Angulation occurs when angle between nodes is measured to estimate location.

    (iii)	
    Trilateration. Location of node is estimated through distance measurement from three nodes. In this concept, intersection of three         circles is calculated, which gives a single point which is a position of unlocalized node.

    (iv)	
    Multilateration. In this concept, more than three nodes are used in location estimation.

    (v)	
    Triangulation. In this mechanism, at least two angles of an unlocalized node from two localized nodes are measured to estimate its         position. Trigonometric laws, law of sines and cosines are used to estimate node position [16].

    Localization schemes are classified as anchor based or anchor free, centralized or distributed, GPS based or GPS free, fine grained or     coarse grained, stationary or mobile sensor nodes, and range based or range free. We will briefly discuss all of these methods.
